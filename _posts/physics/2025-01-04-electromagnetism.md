# Electromagnetism: Unifying Electric and Magnetic Phenomena

Electromagnetism represents one of the greatest unifications in physics, showing that electric and magnetic phenomena are different aspects of a single fundamental force. Maxwell's theory not only explained existing observations but predicted electromagnetic waves, leading to technologies that define modern civilization.

## Historical Development

### Early Discoveries

#### Electric Phenomena
- **Ancient observations**: Amber attracting small objects (electron = "amber" in Greek)
- **Benjamin Franklin**: Lightning as electrical phenomenon, positive/negative charges
- **Coulomb's law (1785)**: Force between electric charges
- **Galvani and Volta**: Animal electricity and electric batteries

#### Magnetic Phenomena
- **Natural magnets**: Lodestone (magnetite) discoveries
- **Compass navigation**: Chinese magnetic compass (11th century)
- **Gilbert's "De Magnete" (1600)**: Earth as giant magnet
- **Magnetic poles**: Cannot be isolated (no magnetic monopoles)

### The Connection Emerges

#### Oersted's Discovery (1820)
Electric current deflects compass needle - **electricity produces magnetism**

#### Ampère's Law (1826)
**Magnetic field around current-carrying wire**: B ∝ I/r

#### Faraday's Discovery (1831)
**Changing magnetic field produces electric current** (electromagnetic induction)

#### Lenz's Law (1834)
**Induced current opposes the change** that produces it

### Maxwell's Synthesis (1864)

#### The Missing Link
Maxwell added "displacement current" to Ampère's law, predicting:
- **Changing electric field produces magnetic field**
- **Electromagnetic waves** traveling at speed of light
- **Light is electromagnetic radiation**

## Electric Fields and Forces

#### Properties:
- **Inverse square law**: Like gravity but much stronger
- **Attractive/repulsive**: Unlike charges attract, like charges repel
- **Superposition**: Forces add vectorially

### Electric Field

**E = kq/r²** (radially outward for positive charge)

#### Field Lines:
- **Start**: On positive charges
- **End**: On negative charges
- **Density**: Proportional to field strength
- **Never cross**: Each point has unique field direction

### Electric Potential

#### Definition:
**V = U/q** (potential energy per unit charge)

**V = kq/r**

#### Relationship to field:
**E = -∇V** (field points toward decreasing potential)
