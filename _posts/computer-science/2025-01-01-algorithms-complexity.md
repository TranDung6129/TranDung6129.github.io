# Algorithms and Complexity Analysis: The Foundation of Computer Science

Algorithms are the heart of computer science - step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems. Understanding how to design efficient algorithms and analyze their complexity is fundamental to writing effective software and solving real-world problems. This exploration covers the essential concepts of algorithmic thinking and complexity analysis that every computer scientist should master.

## What are Algorithms?

### Definition
An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous instructions for solving a problem or performing a computation.

### Key Properties
- **Finiteness**: Must terminate after finite steps
- **Definiteness**: Each step must be precisely defined
- **Input**: Zero or more inputs
- **Output**: One or more outputs
- **Effectiveness**: Steps must be basic enough to be carried out

### Algorithm vs. Program
- **Algorithm**: Abstract description of computation
- **Program**: Implementation of algorithm in specific language
- **Data Structure**: Organization of data for efficient algorithm execution

## Asymptotic Analysis and Big O Notation

### Why Asymptotic Analysis?

#### Machine Independence
**Focuses on growth rate** rather than constant factors that depend on hardware.

#### Large Input Behavior
**Most important for practical applications** - how does performance scale?

#### Simplification
**Ignores lower-order terms** and constant factors for cleaner analysis.

### Big O Notation

#### Definition
**f(n) = O(g(n))** if there exist positive constants c and n₀ such that:
f(n) ≤ c·g(n) for all n ≥ n₀

#### Upper Bound
Big O provides an **asymptotic upper bound** on growth rate.

#### Common Complexity Classes
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time
- **O(n³)**: Cubic time
- **O(2ⁿ)**: Exponential time
- **O(n!)**: Factorial time

### Other Asymptotic Notations

#### Big Omega (Ω)
**Lower bound**: f(n) = Ω(g(n)) if g(n) = O(f(n))

#### Big Theta (Θ)
**Tight bound**: f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n))

#### Little o and ω
**Strict bounds**: Asymptotically smaller/larger

### Master Theorem
**For recurrences** of form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n):

- **Case 2**: If f(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a)), then T(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a) log n)
- **Case 3**: If f(n) = Ω(n^(log_b(a+ε))), then T(n) = Θ(f(n))

### Examples
