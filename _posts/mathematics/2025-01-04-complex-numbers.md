# Complex Numbers: Extending the Real Number System

Complex numbers represent one of the most elegant extensions in mathematics, providing solutions to equations that have no real solutions while opening doors to advanced mathematical analysis and practical applications in engineering and physics.

## Introduction to Complex Numbers

### The Need for Complex Numbers

The equation x² = -1 has no solution in the real numbers. To resolve this, mathematicians introduced the imaginary unit:

**i = √(-1)**, where i² = -1

This simple innovation created an entirely new number system with profound implications.

### Definition
A complex number z is written as:
**z = a + bi**

Where:
- a is the **real part**: Re(z) = a
- b is the **imaginary part**: Im(z) = b
- a, b ∈ ℝ (real numbers)

### Special Cases
- **Real numbers**: b = 0, so z = a
- **Pure imaginary**: a = 0, so z = bi
- **Imaginary unit**: a = 0, b = 1, so z = i

## Complex Number Operations

### Addition and Subtraction
**(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i**
**(a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i**

Complex numbers are added component-wise.

### Multiplication
**(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i**

Using the distributive property and i² = -1.

### Complex Conjugate
The complex conjugate of z = a + bi is:
**z̄ = a - bi**

Properties:
- z + z̄ = 2a (real)
- z - z̄ = 2bi (pure imaginary)
- z · z̄ = a² + b² (real and non-negative)

### Division
To divide complex numbers, multiply by the conjugate:

**(a + bi)/(c + di) = [(a + bi)(c - di)]/[(c + di)(c - di)] = [(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i]/(c² + d²)**

## Geometric Representation

### Complex Plane (Argand Diagram)
Complex numbers can be represented as points in a 2D plane:
- Horizontal axis: real part
- Vertical axis: imaginary part
- Point (a,b) represents z = a + bi

### Polar Form
Any complex number can be written as:
**z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = re^(iθ)**

Where:
- **r = |z| = √(a² + b²)** (modulus/magnitude)
- **θ = arg(z) = arctan(b/a)** (argument/angle)

### Euler's Formula
**e^(iθ) = cos θ + i sin θ**

This connects exponential functions with trigonometry, leading to:
**e^(iπ) + 1 = 0**

Often called "Euler's Identity," this equation beautifully connects five fundamental mathematical constants.

## De Moivre's Theorem

For complex numbers in polar form:
**(re^(iθ))^n = r^n e^(inθ)**

Or equivalently:
**(r(cos θ + i sin θ))^n = r^n(cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ))**

### Applications
- **nth roots**: Finding all solutions to z^n = w
- **Trigonometric identities**: Deriving formulas for cos(nθ) and sin(nθ)
- **Power calculations**: Efficient computation of complex powers

## Roots of Complex Numbers

### nth Roots
The equation z^n = w has exactly n solutions:

**z_k = ⁿ√r · e^(i(θ + 2πk)/n)** for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1

Where w = re^(iθ)

### Roots of Unity
The nth roots of unity are solutions to z^n = 1:

**ω_k = e^(2πik/n)** for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1

These form regular polygons on the unit circle.

## Complex Functions

### Polynomial Functions
Complex polynomials behave similarly to real polynomials:
**P(z) = a_n z^n + a_(n-1) z^(n-1) + ... + a_1 z + a_0**

**Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**: Every polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots (counting multiplicity).

### Elementary Functions

#### Exponential Function
**e^z = e^(a+bi) = e^a(cos b + i sin b)**

#### Trigonometric Functions
**sin z = (e^(iz) - e^(-iz))/(2i)**
**cos z = (e^(iz) + e^(-iz))/2**

#### Logarithmic Function
**log z = log r + i(θ + 2πn)** (multi-valued)

### Hyperbolic Functions
**sinh z = (e^z - e^(-z))/2**
**cosh z = (e^z + e^(-z))/2**

## Complex Analysis

### Derivatives
A complex function f(z) is differentiable at z₀ if:

**f'(z₀) = lim_(h→0) [f(z₀ + h) - f(z₀)]/h**

exists (complex limit).

### Analytic Functions
A function is analytic (holomorphic) if it's differentiable in a neighborhood of every point in its domain.

### Cauchy-Riemann Equations
For f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) to be analytic:

**∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y** and **∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x**
