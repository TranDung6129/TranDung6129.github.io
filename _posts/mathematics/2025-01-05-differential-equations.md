# Differential Equations: The Language of Change

Differential equations are mathematical equations that relate functions to their derivatives. They serve as the fundamental language for describing how quantities change in time and space, making them essential tools in physics, engineering, biology, economics, and virtually every quantitative field.

## What are Differential Equations?

A differential equation is an equation involving:
- A function (unknown)
- Its derivatives
- The independent variables

**Example**: dy/dx = 2x describes how y changes with respect to x.

### Why They Matter

Differential equations describe:
- **Motion**: Newton's laws of mechanics
- **Growth**: Population dynamics
- **Heat**: Temperature distribution
- **Waves**: Sound and electromagnetic radiation
- **Finance**: Option pricing models

## Classification of Differential Equations

### By Order
The **order** is the highest derivative present:

- **First-order**: dy/dx = f(x,y)
- **Second-order**: d²y/dx² = f(x, y, dy/dx)
- **nth-order**: Contains nth derivatives

### By Linearity

#### Linear Differential Equations
Can be written as: a₍ₙ₎(x)y⁽ⁿ⁾ + ... + a₁(x)y' + a₀(x)y = g(x)

**Example**: y'' + 3y' + 2y = eˣ

#### Nonlinear Differential Equations
Contain nonlinear terms in y or its derivatives:

**Example**: y'' + sin(y) = 0 (pendulum equation)

### By Type

#### Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
Functions of one variable: dy/dx = f(x,y)

#### Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
Functions of multiple variables: ∂u/∂t = ∂²u/∂x²

## First-Order Differential Equations

### Separable Equations
Form: dy/dx = g(x)h(y)

**Solution method**: Separate variables and integrate:
∫dy/h(y) = ∫g(x)dx

**Example**: 
dy/dx = xy
Solution: ∫dy/y = ∫x dx → ln|y| = x²/2 + C → y = Ae^(x²/2)

### Linear First-Order Equations
Form: dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x)

**Solution method**: Use integrating factor μ(x) = e^∫P(x)dx

**Solution**: y = (1/μ(x))[∫μ(x)Q(x)dx + C]

### Exact Equations
Form: M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0

**Condition**: ∂M/∂y = ∂N/∂x

**Solution**: Find function F(x,y) such that ∂F/∂x = M and ∂F/∂y = N

## Second-Order Linear Differential Equations

### Homogeneous Equations
Form: ay'' + by' + cy = 0 (constant coefficients)

**Solution method**: Characteristic equation ar² + br + c = 0

**Cases**:
1. **Distinct real roots** r₁, r₂: y = C₁e^(r₁x) + C₂e^(r₂x)
2. **Repeated root** r: y = (C₁ + C₂x)e^(rx)
3. **Complex roots** α ± βi: y = e^(αx)(C₁cos(βx) + C₂sin(βx))

### Non-Homogeneous Equations
Form: ay'' + by' + cy = f(x)

**Solution**: y = y₍ₕ₎ + y₍ₚ₎
- y₍ₕ₎: homogeneous solution
- y₍ₚ₎: particular solution

**Methods for particular solutions**:
- **Undetermined coefficients**: For polynomial, exponential, trigonometric f(x)
- **Variation of parameters**: General method

## System of Differential Equations

### Linear Systems
**x' = Ax + b** where x is a vector, A is a matrix

**Solution approach**:
1. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A
2. Construct fundamental matrix
3. Apply initial conditions

### Phase Portraits
Graphical representation showing solution trajectories in the phase plane.

**Critical points**: Where x' = 0
**Stability types**:
- **Node**: All trajectories approach/leave point
- **Saddle**: Some approach, some leave
- **Spiral**: Trajectories spiral in/out
- **Center**: Closed orbits

## Applications in Physics

### Classical Mechanics

#### Simple Harmonic Motion
mx'' + kx = 0
**Solution**: x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ) where ω = √(k/m)

#### Damped Oscillator
mx'' + bx' + kx = 0
**Behavior depends on damping**:
- **Underdamped**: Oscillatory decay
- **Critically damped**: Fastest approach to equilibrium
- **Overdamped**: Exponential approach

#### Forced Oscillations
mx'' + bx' + kx = F₀cos(ωt)
**Leads to resonance** when driving frequency ≈ natural frequency

### Heat Equation
∂u/∂t = α∇²u

Describes temperature distribution over time and space.

### Wave Equation
∂²u/∂t² = c²∇²u

Describes vibrations, sound waves, electromagnetic waves.

## Applications in Biology

### Population Dynamics

#### Exponential Growth
dP/dt = rP
**Solution**: P(t) = P₀e^(rt)

#### Logistic Growth
dP/dt = rP(1 - P/K)
**Solution**: P(t) = K/(1 + ((K-P₀)/P₀)e^(-rt))

#### Predator-Prey Model (Lotka-Volterra)
dx/dt = ax - bxy (prey)
dy/dt = -cy + dxy (predator)

**Results in oscillatory populations**

### Epidemiology

#### SIR Model
dS/dt = -βSI
dI/dt = βSI - γI  
dR/dt = γI

Models spread of infectious diseases.

## Applications in Engineering

H(s) = Y(s)/X(s) in Laplace domain

## Applications in Economics

Determines fair price of financial options.

## Numerical Methods

When analytical solutions are impossible, use numerical methods:

### Euler's Method
y₍ₙ₊₁₎ = yₙ + h·f(xₙ, yₙ)

Simple but less accurate.

### Runge-Kutta Methods
More accurate than Euler's method:

#### Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4)
Standard method balancing accuracy and computational cost.

### Finite Difference Methods

Transform differential equations into algebraic equations:

L{y'} = sY(s) - y(0)
L{y''} = s²Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)

**Process**:
1. Transform the differential equation
2. Solve algebraically
3. Inverse transform to get solution

## Stability Theory
